    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The best strawberry sorbet should also be the simplest. There should be berries—small enough to pop several in your mouth, and sweet enough to eat straight with a smile. There should be sugar. There should be some acid if needed, and some salt to make the flavor sing. And that's really it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 quarts strawberries, washed (about 2 1/2 pounds)</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice, to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove tops from strawberries and purée in a blender or food processor until smooth. 2 quarts whole strawberries should yield 1 quart of purée. Add sugar and blend for 30 seconds. Add lemon and salt, blend to incorporate, and adjust to taste.</li>
        <li>Strain purée and transfer to refrigerator; chill for 2 to 3 hours until very cold. Churn sorbet in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer sorbet to freezer to firm up for 2 to 3 hours before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These fries have savory, crisp, dry edges, and they're satisfying and somewhat addictive, just like regular fries. I use a mix of regular and sweet potatoes for this. Choose waxy potatoes, like new potatoes or red potatoes, which have a lower glycemic index than starchy russets.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound waxy potatoes, such as red potatoes</li>
        <li>1 pound sweet potatoes, cut in half crosswise</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Kosher salt or coarse sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil, shiny side up. Place in the oven while you prepare the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Cut the potatoes into wedges that are ¼ inch to ½ inch thick at the thickest point and toss with the olive oil and salt.</li>
        <li>Remove the hot pan from the oven, and add the potatoes to the pan in an even layer. They should sizzle. Return to the oven, and lower the heat to 450 degrees. Roast 25 minutes or until tender.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the oven, and loosen the potatoes from the foil using an offset spatula. Return to the oven and cook for another five minutes. Serve at once, seasoned with more salt if desired.</li>
    </ol>
